# CompilerSutra

CompilerSutra is a technology learning platform created to simplify complex concepts across a wide range of software engineering domains. It covers everything from compilers and low-level systems programming to full-stack development, DevOps, AI, and beyond.

The goal is to help developers — whether beginners or professionals — build a deep, practical understanding of how things work, no matter the stack or specialization.

## Why CompilerSutra?

While most tutorials are either too abstract or oversimplified, CompilerSutra focuses on practical, hands-on learning through real projects and code walkthroughs. It's designed to help you connect the dots between theory and implementation — across any technology.

CompilerSutra is built by developers who’ve been through the same learning curve and want to share that knowledge with clarity and depth.

## What You’ll Learn

The platform is continuously evolving and currently includes topics such as:

* Compiler and systems programming (LLVM, IR, optimization)
* GPU development and parallel programming
* Linux internals and operating system fundamentals
* Full-stack development and backend services
* DevOps practices (CI/CD, containers, automation)
* AI, ML, and data workflows
* Coding patterns, DSA, and interview preparation

You’ll also find content that spans languages like C++, Python, Java, JavaScript, and more — with the flexibility to explore whichever stack you’re working on or interested in.
