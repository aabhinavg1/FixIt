## Cleaning Up After Your PR is Merged

After your pull request has been merged, you can clean up your local and remote branches with these commands:

```bash
# Switch back to main branch (or master)
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes from upstream main branch
git pull upstream main

# Delete your feature branch locally
git branch -d your-feature-name

# Delete your feature branch from your GitHub fork
git push origin --delete your-feature-name
```

If you haven't set upstream remote yet, add it like this:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/aabhinavg1/FixIt.git
```
