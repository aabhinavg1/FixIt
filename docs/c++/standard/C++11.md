# C++11:
When new beginner hears the word ``C++11`` for him it like a technical jargon whom beginner things to learn and know. But you know what ``C++11`` know as ``C++11`` because it was introduce in the year 2011 nothing much scientific about the name . 

## Understanding C++11
``Version of the C++`` Programming language which standardized in ``2011`` is name as "C++11". Without much thinking put one thing in a mind that "C++11" simply refers the year of its introduction without any ``complex scientific implication``.

## What is their in C++11?
C++11 is an updated version of ``C++`` which get ``standardized in 2011`` this standarization has introduced ``modern features`` to make programming ``easier``, ``safer``, and ``faster``. Here are a few key highlights:

1. **Smart Pointers** â€“ Manage memory automatically, so you donâ€™t need to use `new` and `delete`.
2. **Lambdas** â€“ Small, inline functions for quick use.
3. **`auto` Keyword** â€“ Lets the compiler figure out variable types.
4. **Range-based `for` Loops** â€“ A simpler way to loop through collections.
5. **`nullptr`** â€“ A better, safer replacement for `NULL`.
6. **Concurrency** â€“ Basic support for multi-threading with tools like `std::thread`.
7. **Move Semantics** â€“ Makes copying big objects faster.

## C++11 Language Features:
### attirbutes:

### auto:
Variables declared with the `auto` keyword enable the compiler to automatically determine their data type based on the expression assigned to them during initialization. This feature simplifies code by reducing the need for explicit type declarations, allowing for cleaner and more concise syntax.

For instance, if you initialize a variable with an integer value, the compiler will deduce its type as `int`. Similarly, if you assign a floating-point number, it will infer the type as `float` or `double` accordingly. This not only saves developers time but also helps prevent type-related errors by ensuring that the variableâ€™s type is consistently derived from its initial value.

Moreover, `auto` enhances code maintainability, especially in cases involving complex types, such as iterators or lambda expressions, where the type might be cumbersome to write out explicitly. Hereâ€™s a quick example:

```cpp
auto count = 10;          // count is deduced as int
auto price = 19.99;       // price is deduced as double
auto name = "CompilerSutra";   // name is deduced as const char*
auto variable = { 0 };           // std::initializer_list<int>
auto required_initializer;       // as here no data type is initialized so compile will throw error as{required_initiailizer}
```
In each case, the compiler takes the initializer's type and assigns it to the variable, allowing developers to focus more on the logic rather than type management.

### char32_t and char16_t:
`char16_t` and `char32_t` are types introduced in C++11 to represent UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoded characters, respectively. They enable the representation of a wide range of Unicode characters, making it easier to handle international text. For example:

```cpp
char16_t utf16_char = u'ä½ ';  // A Unicode character in UTF-16
char32_t utf32_char = U'ðŸ˜Š';  // A Unicode character in UTF-32
```

### converting constructors:
Converting constructors are special constructors in C++ that allow for implicit conversion from one type to another when initializing an object. They provide a way to create an object of a class from an object of a different type, enabling flexible type conversions without requiring an explicit cast.

For example, if you have a class `Point` that represents a 2D point using integer coordinates, you could define a converting constructor that accepts a `double` to facilitate the creation of a `Point` object from a `double` representing a point's coordinate. For example:

```cpp
class Point {
public:
    int x, y;

    // Converting constructor
    Point(double coord) {
        x = static_cast<int>(coord);
        y = static_cast<int>(coord);
    }
};

Point p = 5.7; // Implicit conversion from double to Point
```
### constexpr:
`constexpr` is a keyword introduced in C++11 that indicates that a function or variable can be evaluated at compile time. This allows for optimizations and can lead to more efficient code by enabling the compiler to perform computations during the compilation process instead of at runtime.

Using `constexpr` can significantly improve performance, especially in contexts where the result of a computation is needed repeatedly and can be determined beforehand. For example:

```cpp
constexpr int square(int x) {
    return x * x;  // This function can be evaluated at compile time
}

constexpr int result = square(5); // result is evaluated at compile time
```
### decltype:
`decltype` is a keyword introduced in C++11 that allows you to query the type of an expression at compile time. This feature is particularly useful in template programming and when working with complex types, as it helps to avoid manual type declarations and enhances type safety.
### Key Features:
- **Type Deduction:** `decltype` deduces the type of an expression without evaluating it. This is useful for ensuring that variables and return types are correctly typed based on existing expressions.
- **constexpr and Reference:**: `decltype` preserves the type properties of the expression, including constness and reference qualifiers. For example, if you use `decltype` on an lvalue, it yields a reference type; if you use it on an rvalue, it yields a non-reference type. For example:

```cpp
int x = 42;
decltype(x) y = 10;         // y is deduced to be of type int

const int& z = x;
decltype(z) w = z;          // w is deduced to be const int& (a reference type)
```

### Default functions:
In C++11, a default function is a member function that the compiler automatically provides if no user-defined version is declared, including constructors, destructors, and copy/move assignment operators. Developers can explicitly request a default implementation by using the `= default;` syntax, which allows for cleaner code while ensuring correct behavior in resource management and object copying. For example:
```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    // Default constructor
    MyClass() = default;

    // Default destructor
    ~MyClass() = default;

    // Defaulted copy constructor
    MyClass(const MyClass&) = default;

    // Defaulted copy assignment operator
    MyClass& operator=(const MyClass&) = default;
};
```

### Deleted functions:
In C++11, deleted functions are member functions explicitly marked as deleted using the `= delete;` syntax to prevent certain operations, such as copying or moving objects. This feature helps enforce design decisions by disallowing operations that may lead to undefined behavior or logical errors. When a deleted function is called, the compiler generates a compile-time error, making it clear that the operation is not permitted. This is particularly useful for classes that manage resources, where copying or moving may not make sense. Overall, deleted functions enhance code safety and maintainability by providing clear boundaries around object management. For example:
```cpp
class NonCopyable {
public:
    NonCopyable() = default;
    NonCopyable(const NonCopyable&) = delete;            // Disable copy constructor
    NonCopyable& operator=(const NonCopyable&) = delete; // Disable copy assignment
};

NonCopyable obj1;
NonCopyable obj2 = obj1; // Error: use of deleted function
```
### Delegating constructors:
In C++11, constructors can call other constructors within the same class using an initializer list, a feature known as delegating constructors. This allows one constructor to invoke another, facilitating code reuse and reducing duplication of initialization logic. By delegating initialization, developers can create cleaner and more maintainable code, as common setup tasks can be centralized in one place.
```cpp
class Circle {
public:
    double radius;

    // Delegating constructor
    Circle() : Circle(1.0) { } // Calls the parameterized constructor

    Circle(double r) : radius(r) { } // Parameterized constructor
};

Circle defaultCircle; // Initializes with radius=1.0
```
In this example, the default constructor of `Circle` delegates to the parameterized constructor, ensuring consistent initialization of the `radius` member variable while minimizing code redundancy.

### Explicit conversion functions:
In C++11, conversion functions can be marked as explicit using the `explicit` specifier, which prevents implicit type conversions and enhances type safety. This allows developers to control how and when conversions are performed, reducing the risk of unintentional or erroneous conversions that could lead to bugs.
- **Explicit Conversion Functions**: By declaring a conversion function as `explicit`, it ensures that the conversion can only be invoked through a direct cast or explicit call, preventing automatic or implicit conversions.
- **Improved Type Safety**: This feature helps in maintaining type integrity, as it requires developers to be intentional when converting between types. For example:
```cpp
class Distance {
public:
    explicit Distance(int meters) : meters(meters) { }
    int meters;
};

// Implicit conversion will cause a compile-time error
// Distance d = 5; // Error: cannot convert int to Distance

// Explicit conversion is allowed
Distance d = Distance(5); // OK: explicit conversion
```

In this example, the constructor of `Distance` is marked as explicit, which prevents implicit conversion from `int` to `Distance`. This means that developers must explicitly create a `Distance` object when converting from an `int`, thereby enhancing type safety and reducing potential errors in the code.

### Explicit virtual overrides:
In C++11, the `override` specifier can be used to indicate that a virtual function is intended to override a virtual function in a base class. This feature enhances code safety by ensuring that the derived class function indeed overrides a base class function. If the specified function does not correctly override a parent's virtual function, the compiler will generate an error, helping to catch mistakes early in the development process.
- **Clarifies Intent**: The `override` specifier makes the developer's intent clear, indicating that the function is meant to override a virtual function from a base class.
- **Compiler Error for Mismatches**: If there is a mismatch, such as a signature difference or if the base function is not virtual, the compiler will issue an error, reducing the likelihood of subtle bugs. For example:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() { } // Virtual function in base class
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override { } // Correctly overrides Base::display

    // Uncommenting the following line will cause a compiler error
    // void show() override { } // Error: 'show' does not override any base class method
};
```

In this example, the `display` function in the `Derived` class correctly uses the `override` specifier to indicate it is overriding the `display` function from the `Base` class. If the `Derived` class were to declare a function that does not actually override a base class function, the compiler would produce an error, thus helping maintain correct polymorphic behavior.

### Final specifier:
In C++11, the `final` specifier is used to indicate that a virtual function cannot be overridden in any derived class or that a class itself cannot be inherited from. This feature is useful for enforcing design constraints and maintaining the integrity of class hierarchies by preventing further modifications to certain functionalities.
- **Prevent Overriding**: When applied to a virtual function, the `final` specifier prevents any derived class from overriding that function, ensuring the behavior remains consistent and cannot be altered.
- **Prevent Inheritance**: When applied to a class, the `final` specifier prevents any other class from inheriting from it, which can be useful for utility classes or when implementing the singleton design pattern. For example:
```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() final { // This function cannot be overridden
        // Implementation
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    // Uncommenting the following line will cause a compiler error
    // void display() override { } // Error: 'display' is final
};

class FinalClass final { // This class cannot be inherited
public:
    void show() { }
};

// Uncommenting the following line will cause a compiler error
// class AnotherClass : public FinalClass { }; // Error: 'FinalClass' is final
```

In this example:
- The `display` function in the `Base` class is marked as `final`, which prevents any derived class from overriding it.
- The `FinalClass` cannot be inherited from, ensuring its functionality remains unchanged and cannot be extended. Attempting to override a final function or inherit from a final class will result in a compile-time error, thus enforcing the intended constraints in the class design.

## Forwarding references: 
In C++11, **forwarding references** make it easier to write functions that can accept any type of argument and keep it in its original form (whether it's a regular variable or a temporary value).

**How forwading reference work**
1. **Syntax**: Forwarding references are written as `T&&` in a **template function**. For example:

   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   void myFunction(T&& arg);
   ```

2. **Why Theyâ€™re Useful**: With forwarding references, a function can accept both:
   - **Lvalues** (like variables you can assign to).
   - **Rvalues** (temporary values that only exist for a moment).

3. **Using `std::forward`**: When you pass the argument to another function, **`std::forward`** keeps its original form:
   - If itâ€™s a regular variable, it stays a regular variable.
   - If itâ€™s a temporary, it stays a temporary.

   ```cpp
   template <typename T>
   void myFunction(T&& arg) {
       anotherFunction(std::forward<T>(arg));  // Keeps "arg" in its original form
   }
   ```

### Simple Example:
Hereâ€™s a quick example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

void process(int& x) {
    std::cout << "Regular variable\n";
}

void process(int&& x) {
    std::cout << "Temporary value\n";
}

template <typename T>
void forwarder(T&& arg) {
    process(std::forward<T>(arg));  // Keeps "arg" in its original form
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    forwarder(x);        // Calls the regular variable version
    forwarder(20);       // Calls the temporary value version
}
```
:::note
Forwarding references let functions handle all types of arguments in the most efficient way. By using `std::forward`, you keep the argument's original type, whether it's a variable or a temporary value.
