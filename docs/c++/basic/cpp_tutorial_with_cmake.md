# C++ Tutorial with Basic CMake

## Summary

This tutorial introduces C++, explaining why it is important for performance-critical applications, and guides you through setting up a simple C++ project using CMake. You'll write a basic "Hello, World!" program, create a `CMakeLists.txt` file, and compile the project using CMake, a versatile tool for cross-platform builds.
## What is C++? 🤔

C++ is one of the most powerful programming languages out there! 🦾 Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1983 as an improvement of the C language, it was designed to be **fast**, **efficient**, and super versatile. From developing video games 🎮 to operating systems 🖥️, C++ is everywhere.

It's a **middle-level language**, meaning it can do both low-level stuff (like talking to hardware) and high-level things (like creating desktop apps or websites). Basically, C++ is like the Swiss Army knife of programming languages 🔪.

### 🔍 Key Concepts in Simple Terms

<details>
<summary>🎯 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</summary>

Think of OOP like organizing your life into neat little boxes 📦. You can create "blueprints" (called classes) for things like cars 🚗, and then make as many cars (objects) as you want based on that blueprint. This way, your program stays tidy, organized, and easier to handle.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔧 Templates for Reusability</summary>

Why write the same code over and over? With **templates**, you write something once and can reuse it for different data types. It’s like having a universal remote control 🕹️ that works with all your devices, saving time and effort.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📦 Standard Template Library (STL)</summary>

STL is like a magic toolbox ✨ that comes with C++. It gives you ready-made containers (like lists and maps) and tools to quickly sort, search, and manipulate data. No need to reinvent the wheel 🛞!
</details>

<details>
<summary>⚙️ Low-Level Access</summary>

If you want to write programs that can run super-fast 🚀, C++ is your friend. It gives you the power to control how memory and hardware are used, making it perfect for system-level programming, like creating parts of an operating system or controlling a robot 🤖.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🚨 Exception Handling</summary>

Mistakes happen 🤷‍♂️, but C++ won’t let your program crash and burn. It has built-in error-handling so your program can gracefully recover from unexpected problems. Think of it as an airbag for your code 💥🛡️.
</details>

### 🛠️ Real-World Examples of C++ Use

C++ may be behind the scenes, but it powers many of the things we use every day:

- **Operating Systems** 🖥️: Parts of Windows, macOS, and Linux are written in C++. Without it, your computer wouldn’t be able to manage hardware and software efficiently.
  
- **Video Games** 🎮: Games like Fortnite and Call of Duty rely on C++ for smooth graphics and fast gameplay. No one likes lagging, right?

- **Web Browsers** 🌐: Browsers like Chrome and Firefox use C++ to render web pages super fast, so you don’t waste time waiting for your cat GIFs 🐱 to load.

- **Embedded Systems** 🔌: Your smart TV, microwave, and even your car 🚗 likely use C++ for their internal programming. When things need to be fast and efficient, C++ is often the go-to.

- **Scientific Software** 🧬: Programs that do complex calculations for scientific research or financial trading need to be super accurate and fast. C++ is the hero here, too! 🦸‍♂️

### 💡 Why Learn C++? (And Why It's Not as Scary as You Think)
