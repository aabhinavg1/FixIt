# The Complete Evolution of LLVM Pass Infrastructure

## Introduction.

LLVM’s pass infrastructure is one of the most significant architectural ideas to come out of modern compiler research. Introduced during LLVM’s early development at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Illinois_Urbana-Champaign), it established a modular way of building compilers: instead of monolithic optimizers, LLVM breaks the workflow into small, independent units called **passes**. Each pass performs a specific analysis or transformation on the shared intermediate representation (IR).
This modularity is what makes LLVM flexible, extensible, and easy to maintain—even as it grows to support new languages, new hardware, and new optimization techniques.

:::tip **Purpose of This Article**
The goal of this page is to **document how LLVM’s pass infrastructure has evolved over time**—from the early academic versions to the modern, production-grade system used today.
By tracing these changes, readers will understand how LLVM became the optimization engine behind tools such as Apple’s Xcode, Google’s Android NDK, and NVIDIA’s CUDA toolchain.
:::

If you want, I can also rewrite it in a more academic, more casual, or more engineer-to-engineer tone.

<details>
<summary><strong>2000–2003: Academic Prototype</strong></summary>

LLVM began as a research project aimed at exploring the design of a flexible, retargetable compiler. Early passes focused on basic optimizations, such as constant propagation and dead code elimination, primarily for academic experimentation. The **Legacy Pass Manager** was introduced to schedule and coordinate these passes, providing a framework for pass dependencies and execution order.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2010–2015: Modular Redesign and Production Use</strong></summary>

As LLVM gained adoption in industry, its pass infrastructure underwent significant redesigns. 
- The New Pass Manager (NPM) was conceptualized to replace the Legacy Pass Manager, offering improved performance, better memory usage, and a more modular interface. 
- Passes were increasingly decoupled, supporting parallel execution and more precise dependency tracking. 
- During this time, LLVM became the backbone of production compilers for AMD,Intel, Google’s Android NDK,NVDIA ,ARM and other major platforms.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2015–Present: Robust, Scalable, and Extensible </strong></summary>

LLVM's pass infrastructure continues to evolve, with a focus on scalability, maintainability, and integration with advanced analyses like alias analysis, vectorization, and GPU-targeted optimizations.

## Introduction to LLVM Pass Architecture

### What Are LLVM Passes?

LLVM passes are the fundamental units of transformation and analysis in the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Each pass performs a specific operation on the LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR), such as optimizing code, analyzing properties, or transforming representations. 

> ***The pass-based architecture enables compiler developers to build complex optimization pipelines.
To understand more about it visit [compilersutra.com](https://www.compilersutra.com/docs/llvm/intermediate/what_is_llvm_passes/).***

:::tip In short,
The compilation process typically follows this conceptual pipeline:
```python
 Source Code → Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) → Intermediate Representation (IR) → Optimized IR → Machine Code (Assembly).
```
:::caution What Happen when Source Code Parsed Into AST?

Once the ***source code*** has been parsed into an ***AST*** and ***lowered to LLVM's Intermediate Representation (IR)***, the core work of the compiler begins: 
> ***modifying, optimizing, and validating this IR until it is ready to be translated into efficient machine code.***
 
 :::important LLVM Passes
The components responsible for these ***transformations and analyses*** are called LLVM Passes.
:::

## Why LLVM Passes Are Important

The importance of LLVM passes stems from their role as the fundamental orchestrators of code analysis and transformation. They transform the LLVM compiler from a static translator into a dynamic, adaptable, and powerful system for program manipulation.

LLVM passes act as specialized components that each tackle a specific task within the compilation pipeline. This modular design is critical for several reasons, which are explored in the following sections.

:::tip Core Enablers of Modern Compilation
LLVM passes provide the essential building blocks for the modern compilation and optimization process, enabling key capabilities that would be difficult or impossible to achieve with a monolithic architecture.
:::

The importance of passes is further highlighted by the ongoing evolution of the infrastructure that manages them. The transition from the [**Legacy Pass Manager**](https://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html) to the **New Pass Manager (NPM)**(https://llvm.org/docs/NewPassManager.html) addresses critical limitations. The NPM, now the default for the optimization pipeline, provides more efficient analysis caching, finer-grained dependency tracking, and better support for pass managers within pass managers. This evolution underscores that the pass model is not static; it continuously improves to handle larger codebases, more complex optimizations, and emerging parallel compilation needs. Understanding the differences between these managers is essential for anyone writing or maintaining [LLVM passes](https://llvm.org/docs/NewPassManager.html#status-of-the-new-and-legacy-pass-managers) today.

Some of them  are 
<details>
<summary><strong>Enabling Modular and Composable Optimizations</strong></summary>

 The single most important feature of the pass system is modularity. 
 - Each pass is a self-contained unit with a specific, well-defined purpose,
   such as eliminating dead code or analyzing memory aliasing. 
 - This allows compiler engineers and researchers to develop, test, and combine transformations independently. 
 - Complex optimization pipelines (like `-O2` or `-O3`) are simply pre-defined sequences of these modular passes. 

>***This composition model is far more flexible and maintainable than a large, intertwined codebase.***

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Separating Analysis from Transformation</strong></summary>

- The infrastructure cleanly distinguishes between **Analysis Passes**, which gather 
 information about the code (e.g., a dominator tree or alias analysis results), and 
**Transform Passes**, which modify the code based on that information. 

- This separation is a classic software engineering principle that prevents analysis 
  logic from being duplicated across transformations and allows expensive analyses to be 
  computed once and reused by many subsequent passes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Managing Complexity Through Scoped Execution</strong></summary>

- Passes are categorized by the scope of code they operate on
    >**Module**, **Function**, **Loop**, or **Basic Block**. 
- This granularity allows the Pass Manager to apply optimizations 
  efficiently and in the correct order. For example, a **FunctionPass**
  can safely transform each function in isolation without worrying about 
  interactions with others, simplifying both the pass logic and the overall pipeline scheduling.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Engine of Performance and Correctness</strong></summary>

***Beyond structural benefits, passes are the direct mechanism through which compilers achieve their primary goals: 
generating fast, correct, and specialized code.***


<details>
<summary><strong>Driving Performance Optimizations</strong></summary>

The vast majority of performance gains in compiled code come from passes.
- Key transformations include **Global Value Numbering (GVN)** to eliminate 
  redundant computations, **Loop Unrolling** to expose instruction-level parallelism, 
  and **Inlining** to reduce function call overhead. 
- These passes directly translate high-level code patterns into more efficient low-level sequences.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Ensuring Code Safety and Sanitization*</strong></summary>

- Passes are not only for optimization. 
- Instrumentation passes like **AddressSanitizer (ASan)** and **MemorySanitizer (MSan)** 
  inject runtime checks to detect ***memory corruption***, ***use-after-free***, and ***reads of uninitialized memory***. 
  These passes are crucial for modern software development, shifting the detection of elusive bugs from 
  production to the testing phase.
</details>


<details>
<summary><strong>Facilitating Target-Specific Code Generation</strong></summary>

- While middle-end passes are largely target-independent, the backend heavily relies on passes 
  to generate quality machine code. Passes for **instruction selection**, **register allocation**, 
  and **instruction scheduling** are tailored to the specifics of CPU architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V) 
  and accelerators (GPUs). This allows LLVM to support a wide range of hardware from a common IR.
</details>
</details>

:::caution Apart from this
The LLVM pass infrastructure transforms the compiler into a versatile platform for research and proprietary tooling by enabling custom plugins and structured APIs, while simultaneously serving as the critical foundation for advanced ***compilation techniques like Link-Time Optimization (LTO) and Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO)*** by orchestrating whole-program analysis and feedback-driven transformations.

:::note In Summary
In summary, LLVM passes are important because they provide the **modular units of work**, the **structured framework for interaction**, and the **extensible plugin interface** that collectively make LLVM a versatile, high-performance, and adaptable compiler infrastructure used from academia to industry.

I hope this detailed explanation helps solidify your understanding of LLVM's core architecture. Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points, such as the practical differences between writing a pass for the Legacy vs. the New Pass Manager?

##### Transform Passes — Categorized (with Links)

Transform passes are compiler passes that modify the ***LLVM Intermediate Representation (IR)*** to optimize the program, improve performance, or prepare it for code generation. 
They perform concrete transformations such as eliminating dead code, inlining functions, simplifying control flow, or optimizing loops and memory usage.

⚡⚡ **Key Point:** Unlike analysis passes, transform passes actively change IR to improve efficiency or canonicalize the code.

##### Utility Passes — Definition

Utility passes are compiler passes that **help developers inspect, debug, or verify LLVM IR**. They generally **do not perform optimizations** but provide tools for analysis, visualization, and debugging. Some are intended **only for internal or debugging purposes**.

⚡ **Key Point:** Utility passes are mostly diagnostic; some (like `deadarghaX0r`) are experimental or meant for LLVM developers and should not be used in production code.

## Closing Note

This list is a **high-level overview of the LLVM passes**, compiled using the official LLVM documentation as a reference. 
The goal here is not to explain every pass in depth, but to serve as a **central index** for developers, students, and compiler engineers
 who want to understand the structure of the LLVM pass ecosystem.

I will be publishing **individual deep-dive articles** for **each pass—one by one—from the earliest LLVM versions to the latest**.
Each dedicated article will cover:

* What the pass does
* Why it exists
* Internal algorithms
* Historical evolution (legacy PM → new PM)
* Example IR before/after
* Practical usage (`opt`/`clang` flags)
* Real GPU/CPU compiler impacts

All passes in this list will eventually be linked to their detailed standalone articles as they are published.

Stay tuned — the full pass-by-pass exploration of LLVM is coming soon.
