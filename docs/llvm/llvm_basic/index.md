## üéâ Pass

### [What Are LLVM Passes?](./pass/Understanding_LLVM_Pass.md)
LLVM passes are modular components that analyze and transform the Intermediate Representation (IR) of code within the LLVM framework. They are crucial for optimization, code analysis, and generation.

### Categories of Passes
1. **Analysis Passes**
   - Provide insights into the code without modifying it.
   - Examples: Loop Analysis, Alias Analysis.

2. **Transformation Passes**
   - Modify the IR to optimize or restructure the code.
   - Examples: Dead Code Elimination, Inlining.

3. **Utility Passes**
   - Assist other passes by providing useful utilities.
   - Examples: Verifier Pass, Print Module Pass.

### Commonly Used Passes
- **Function Inlining:** Replaces function calls with the function‚Äôs body to reduce call overhead.
- **Dead Code Elimination:** Removes code that does not affect program results.
- **Loop Unrolling:** Expands loops to decrease loop overhead and increase performance.

### How to Work with Passes
1. **Enable Passes:** Use `opt` command-line tool to apply passes to an IR file.
   ```bash
   opt -passes=<pass-name> input.ll -o output.ll
