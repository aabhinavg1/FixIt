# üìò LLVM Advanced Documentation

Welcome to the **LLVM Advanced Documentation** section! This guide includes detailed instructions on managing LLVM versions, exploring more in-depth concepts, and translating your LLVM documentation site.

## üìÑ Contents

- **[Managing LLVM Versions](manage_llvm_version.md)**  
  Discover best practices for managing multiple versions of LLVM, including installation, version switching, and handling dependencies to support different projects.

- **[Power of LLVM](More_About_LLVM.md)**  
  Know here about the `Power of LLVM` and know `What is LLVM`. This article covers LLVM's ``architecture, benefits``, and ``how it stands`` out from other ``virtual machines`` and ``compilers``.

- **[C Code to Executable using LLVM](translate-your-site.md)**  
  A guide on converting the `C executable` to your `LLVM IR` and then to the `executable`.
  Learn how to convert your ``C code`` to the ``executable`` by converting to `LLVM IR.`


- **[Enable and Disable LLVM Passes](./disable_llvm_pass.md)**  
  A guide on controlling LLVM optimization passes in your compilation pipeline.  
  Learn how to **enable** or **disable** specific `LLVM passes` to fine-tune optimizations for your program.
