# How to See Time of Each Pass in LLVM

## Why Analyze LLVM Pass Timings?

Think of a scenario where yor team is at an AI research lab, where your team work is to  ``optimizing deep learning models`` for a ``high-performance`` GPU accelerator. Your team is developing a custom compiler backend or want to improve already implemented backend whose aim is to generate optimized machine code for AI workloads, ensuring that models run efficiently on ``specialized hardware``.  
:::note  
If your **compiler stack is based on LLVM**, ``obviously `yes` it should be based oon LLVM if not please discuss with your team why not?`` `` analyzing **LLVM pass timings** becomes essential.  

### Why is it essential?  
- **Identifying Performance Bottlenecks**: LLVM optimization passes such as analysis or transform may take excessive time, impacting overall compilation speed.  
- **Reducing Unnecessary Optimizations**: Certain passes might not contribute significantly to AI workload performance and can be skipped or reordered.  
- **Improving Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: Many AI workloads depend on JIT compilation, where slow LLVM passes can introduce runtime delays.  
- **Enhancing Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: GPUs and CPUs require different code transformations. Understanding pass timings helps fine-tune optimizations for the target hardware.  
- **Optimizing Large-Scale Deployments**: In large AI inference/training clusters, reducing compile times leads to faster model iteration and deployment cycles.  
:::

However, as your deep learning models grow in complexity—introducing new tensor operations, larger batch sizes, and mixed-precision computations—**if you dont want to optimize it the compilation times skyrocket**. A simple model update that once took seconds to compile now takes minutes or even hours. This bottleneck disrupts development cycles, slowing down research iterations and delaying model deployment.  

If your **compiler stack is based on LLVM**, analyzing **LLVM pass timings** becomes essential. Many AI compilers rely on LLVM for **both GPU and CPU optimizations**, including:  

- **MLIR (Multi-Level IR)**: Used in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and other AI frameworks to optimize tensor operations before lowering to LLVM IR.  
- **TVM**: A deep learning compiler stack that converts high-level models into efficient **GPU/CPU code** using LLVM as a backend.  
- **Triton**: A specialized AI compiler for writing high-performance GPU kernels with LLVM IR optimizations.  
- **LLVM AMDGPU & NVPTX Backends**: Used for generating optimized machine code for AMD and NVIDIA GPUs.  
- **XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)**: A compiler used in TensorFlow that lowers deep learning models to optimized LLVM-based execution on both CPUs and GPUs.  

### Why Does Compilation Time Matter?  

In **GPU and CPU computing for AI**, compiler performance is critical because:  

- **Kernel Compilation for GPUs**: AI workloads rely on optimized GPU kernels for matrix multiplications, convolutions, and activation functions. Slow compilation affects performance tuning and deployment.  
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: AI frameworks like TensorFlow XLA and PyTorch TorchScript rely on JIT compilers to optimize models at runtime. A slow LLVM backend can lead to excessive overhead during execution.  
- **Auto-Tuning and Code Generation**: AI compilers dynamically generate optimized GPU and CPU code. Analyzing LLVM pass timings helps identify inefficiencies and speed up compilation.  
- **CI/CD for AI Models**: Continuous training and deployment pipelines require frequent recompilation of AI models. Slow compilation disrupts the iteration cycle and reduces hardware utilization efficiency.  
- **Heterogeneous Computing**: AI workloads often switch between **CPU and GPU execution**, requiring efficient code generation for both architectures. LLVM pass analysis helps balance optimization strategies across different hardware.  

By profiling **LLVM pass timings**, engineers can pinpoint which optimization passes are slowing down GPU and CPU compilation. Redundant or expensive passes can be reordered, optimized, or disabled based on workload-specific needs. This leads to **faster model training, quicker inference optimizations, and overall better resource utilization** across both GPUs and CPUs.  

In the race for AI acceleration or where performance tuning is crutial their, every millisecond counts—not just in execution, but also in compilation. 🚀  
## Steps to Extract LLVM Pass Timings

    int N) {

    int row = get_global_id(0);
    int col = get_global_id(1);

    float sum = 0.0;
    for (int k = 0; k < N; k++) {
        sum += A[row * N + k] * B[k * N + col];
    }
    C[row * N + col] = sum;

```
:::tip Summary of LLVM Pass Profiling
- The **most time-consuming pass** is `SimplifyCFGPass`, taking **16.1% of the total wall time**. This is expected, as control flow simplifications often involve restructuring large parts of the IR.  
- `InstCombinePass` also consumes significant time (**13.9% wall time**), as it aggressively removes redundant operations and simplifies expressions.  
- `LoopVectorizePass` and `SLPVectorizerPass` show notable execution time, highlighting the compiler’s efforts in **loop optimizations** and **instruction-level parallelism**.  
- Passes like `PrintModulePass` are used mainly for **debugging and analysis**, rather than direct optimization.  
- The total compilation time of **0.0095 seconds** suggests an efficient optimization pipeline, with most passes executing quickly.  

### 🔍 Insights:
- Identifying the most **expensive passes** helps in tuning LLVM optimizations for performance improvements.  
- Depending on the **target architecture and workload**, tweaking pass order or selectively disabling costly passes may enhance compilation efficiency.

### 3. Enable Pass Timing from llc 

To know more about [llc](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llc.html)

Since `llc` does not support the OpenCL backend directly, we first convert our OpenCL C code to AMD LLVM IR using `clang`:  
```rust
bin/clang -Xclang -finclude-default-header -Dcl_clang_storage_class_specifiers \
    -I /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Headers \
    -framework OpenCL \
    -target amdgcn-amd-amdhsa -S -emit-llvm -O2 ../test/matrix_mul.cl -o matrix_mul.ll -nogpulib
```
| Flag | Description |
|------|------------|
| `-Xclang` | Passes the following argument directly to the Clang frontend. |
| `-finclude-default-header` | Ensures OpenCL built-in function headers are included automatically. |
| `-Dcl_clang_storage_class_specifiers` | Defines a macro to enable Clang-specific storage class specifiers for OpenCL. |
| `-I /System/Library/Frameworks/OpenCL.framework/Headers` | Specifies the include path for OpenCL headers. |
| `-framework OpenCL` | Links the OpenCL framework on macOS. |
| `-target amdgcn-amd-amdhsa` | Sets the target architecture to AMD GPU (GCN) for ROCm/HSA execution. |
| `-S` | Outputs assembly instead of an object file. |
| `-emit-llvm` | Generates LLVM IR rather than a machine-specific binary. |
| `-O2` | Optimizes the output at level 2 for a balance of performance and compilation time. |
| `-nogpulib` | Prevents linking with GPU runtime libraries, useful for standalone OpenCL kernel compilation. |

The llc output will be similar to clang and opt but more backend passes name you can see as
