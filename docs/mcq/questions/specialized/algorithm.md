title: C++ and Algorithms
description: |
  This guide explores the use of C++ for implementing a wide range of algorithms, from basic sorting and searching to advanced graph, dynamic programming, and greedy techniques. Understand how the Standard Template Library (STL) supports algorithm development and boosts performance. Ideal for coding interview prep, competitive programming, and building a strong foundation in problem-solving using C++.
