# Memory Management

<Question
  question="1).What is dynamic memory allocation in C++?"
  options={['Allocating memory during runtime', 'Allocating memory during compile time', 'Using static memory', 'None of the above']}
  answer="Allocating memory during runtime"
/>
<Question
  question="2).Which operator is used for dynamic memory allocation?"
  options={['new', 'malloc', 'allocate', 'None of the above']}
  answer="new"
/>
<Question
  question="3).Which operator is used to deallocate memory in C++?"
  options={['delete', 'free', 'dispose', 'None of the above']}
  answer="delete"
/>
<Question
  question="4).What is a memory leak?"
  options={['Memory that is not deallocated', 'Memory allocated at compile time', 'Excessive memory usage', 'None of the above']}
  answer="Memory that is not deallocated"
/>
<Question
  question="5).What is a smart pointer?"
  options={['A pointer that automatically manages memory', 'A pointer that points to other pointers', 'A pointer that only works with arrays', 'None of the above']}
  answer="A pointer that automatically manages memory"
/>
<Question
  question="6).What does the new operator return?"
  options={['A pointer to the allocated memory', 'The size of allocated memory', 'The address of the deallocated memory', 'None of the above']}
  answer="A pointer to the allocated memory"
/>
<Question
  question="7).What is the difference between malloc and new?"
  options={['malloc is procedural, new is object-oriented', 'malloc does not call constructors', 'Both A and B', 'None of the above']}
  answer="Both A and B"
/>
<Question
  question="8).What happens if delete is used on NULL?"
  options={['No operation is performed', 'It causes a segmentation fault', 'It deallocates NULL', 'None of the above']}
  answer="No operation is performed"
/>
<Question
  question="9).Which smart pointer type prevents cyclic references?"
  options={['weak_ptr', 'shared_ptr', 'unique_ptr', 'None of the above']}
  answer="weak_ptr"
/>
<Question
  question="10).What is the purpose of the delete[] operator?"
  options={['To deallocate memory allocated for arrays', 'To deallocate static memory', 'To deallocate class objects', 'None of the above']}
  answer="To deallocate memory allocated for arrays"
/>
