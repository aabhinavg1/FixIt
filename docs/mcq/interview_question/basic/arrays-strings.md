# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Classes and Objects**

## **1. What is a class in C++?**

A **class** is a user-defined data type that serves as a blueprint for creating objects. It encapsulates data and methods into a single entity.

### **Syntax:**

```cpp
class ClassName {
public:
    int data;
    void display() {
        std::cout << "Data: " << data << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### **Example:**

```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    int year;
    
    void showInfo() {
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << ", Year: " << year << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"A class is a template for creating objects. It allows me to encapsulate data (variables) and behaviors (methods) into a single unit."

**When to use:** Use classes when implementing real-world entities with attributes and behaviors.

---

## **2. What is an object in C++?**

An **object** is an instance of a class that holds its own copy of the class attributes.

### **Example:**

```cpp
Car myCar;
myCar.brand = "Toyota";
myCar.year = 2022;
myCar.showInfo();
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"An object is a concrete entity based on a class. It represents an instance with specific values assigned to its attributes."

**When to use:** Use objects to create multiple instances of a class with different data.

---

## **3. What is encapsulation in C++?**

Encapsulation is an **OOP principle** that restricts direct access to object data and allows controlled access through methods.

### **Example:**

```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;

public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }

    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**

"Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods to restrict direct access. I use access modifiers (`private`, `public`) to control access."

**When to use:** Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data.
