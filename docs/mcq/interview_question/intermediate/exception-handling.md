# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Exception Handling**

## **1. What is exception handling in C++?**
Exception handling is a mechanism in C++ to handle runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `catch`, and `throw` keywords.

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    int a = 10, b = 0;
    if (b == 0) throw "Division by zero error!";
    int result = a / b;
} catch (const char* msg) {
    std::cerr << msg << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Exception handling in C++ allows me to handle errors without crashing the program using `try`, `catch`, and `throw`."

**When to use:** Use exception handling when dealing with runtime errors such as division by zero, invalid memory access, and file handling errors.

---

## **2. What are standard exceptions in C++?**
C++ provides a set of standard exceptions derived from the `std::exception` class.

### **Example:**
```cpp
try {
    throw std::runtime_error("Runtime error occurred");
} catch (const std::exception& e) {
    std::cout << "Exception: " << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"C++ has built-in exceptions like `std::runtime_error`, `std::logic_error`, and `std::bad_alloc`. I use them for handling common errors effectively."

**When to use:** Use standard exceptions for common errors like memory allocation failure or logical errors.

---

## **3. How do you create a custom exception in C++?**

### **Example:**
```cpp
class MyException : public std::exception {
public:
    const char* what() const noexcept override {
        return "Custom exception occurred";
    }
};

try {
    throw MyException();
} catch (const MyException& e) {
    std::cout << e.what() << std::endl;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A custom exception in C++ is created by inheriting from `std::exception` and overriding the `what()` function."

**When to use:** Use custom exceptions for specific application errors.

---

## **4. What is exception safety and best practices?**

### **Best Practices:**
- Use `try-catch` only where necessary.
- Prefer RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) for resource management.
- Catch exceptions by reference (`const std::exception&`).
- Use `noexcept` where applicable to avoid unnecessary exception checks.

### **Sample Answer:**
"Exception safety ensures that code behaves correctly even when exceptions occur. I follow best practices like using RAII and avoiding raw pointers."

**When to use:** Use exception safety principles to write robust and maintainable C++ code.
