# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Object-Oriented Programming**

## **1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++?**
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in C++ that organizes code into objects and classes for better modularity and reusability.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Car {
public:
    std::string brand;
    void show() { std::cout << "Car brand: " << brand << std::endl; }
};

int main() {
    Car myCar;
    myCar.brand = "Toyota";
    myCar.show();
    return 0;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"OOP in C++ structures code into objects and classes to improve reusability and maintainability. It follows principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism."

**When to use:** Use OOP for complex systems requiring modularity and scalability.

---

## **2. What is encapsulation in C++?**
Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods within a class while restricting direct access to some components.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class BankAccount {
private:
    double balance;
public:
    void setBalance(double b) { balance = b; }
    double getBalance() { return balance; }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Encapsulation in C++ ensures data protection by restricting direct access and using getter/setter methods."

**When to use:** Use encapsulation to protect sensitive data and enforce data integrity.

---

## **3. What is inheritance in C++?**
Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and methods from another class, enabling code reuse.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Vehicle {
public:
    void honk() { std::cout << "Honk!" << std::endl; }
};

class Car : public Vehicle {};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Inheritance in C++ enables code reuse by allowing a class to inherit properties and behaviors from a base class."

**When to use:** Use inheritance to establish hierarchical relationships and avoid code duplication.

---

## **4. What is polymorphism in C++?**
Polymorphism allows functions or methods to take different forms through function overloading and overriding.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Animal {
public:
    virtual void speak() { std::cout << "Animal speaks" << std::endl; }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void speak() override { std::cout << "Dog barks" << std::endl; }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Polymorphism in C++ enables dynamic method resolution, allowing different behaviors for the same function call."

**When to use:** Use polymorphism for flexible and extensible code design.
