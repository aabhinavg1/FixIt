# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Constructors and Destructors**

## **1. What is a constructor in C++?**
A constructor is a special member function that initializes objects when they are created. It has the same name as the class and no return type.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;
    Example() { x = 10; }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A constructor is automatically called when an object is created and is used to initialize class members."

**When to use:** Use constructors to ensure proper initialization of class objects.

---

## **2. What is a destructor in C++?**
A destructor is a special member function that is executed when an object goes out of scope. It is used for cleanup, such as releasing resources.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    ~Example() {
        std::cout << "Destructor called!" << std::endl;
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A destructor is used to clean up resources when an object is destroyed. It is defined with a tilde (~) before the class name."

**When to use:** Use destructors to manage memory and other resources efficiently.

---

## **3. What is a copy constructor in C++?**
A copy constructor initializes a new object as a copy of an existing object.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int x;
    Example(int val) : x(val) {}
    Example(const Example& obj) { x = obj.x; } // Copy constructor
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A copy constructor creates a new object by copying another object. It is useful for deep copying when dynamic memory allocation is involved."

**When to use:** Use copy constructors to duplicate objects correctly.

---

## **4. What is a move constructor in C++?**
A move constructor transfers resources from a temporary object instead of copying them.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Example {
public:
    int* ptr;
    Example(int val) { ptr = new int(val); }
    Example(Example&& obj) noexcept : ptr(obj.ptr) { obj.ptr = nullptr; } // Move constructor
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"A move constructor efficiently transfers resources from temporary objects, avoiding expensive deep copies."

**When to use:** Use move constructors for optimizing performance when dealing with temporary objects.

---

## **5. What are best practices for constructors and destructors?**
- Use **initializer lists** for efficiency.
- Implement a **copy constructor and assignment operator** when dealing with dynamic memory.
- Use **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)** for automatic resource management.
- Mark the **destructor as virtual** if using inheritance.

### **Sample Answer:**
"To manage object lifecycles properly, I follow best practices like using initializer lists, implementing the Rule of Three/Five, and ensuring proper cleanup in destructors."

**When to use:** Follow best practices to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient object handling.
