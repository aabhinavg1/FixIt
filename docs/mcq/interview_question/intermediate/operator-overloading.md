# **Essential C++ Interview Questions on Operator Overloading**

## **1. What is operator overloading in C++?**
Operator overloading allows customizing the behavior of operators for user-defined types, making code more intuitive.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    Complex operator+(const Complex& obj) {
        return Complex(real + obj.real, imag + obj.imag);
    }
};
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Operator overloading in C++ allows redefining operators for user-defined types, enhancing code readability and usability."

**When to use:** Use operator overloading when working with complex data types to improve code clarity.

## **2. How do you overload the `<<` and `>>` operators in C++?**
The `<<` and `>>` operators are overloaded as friend functions for stream input and output.

### **Example:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
class Complex {
public:
    int real, imag;
    Complex(int r, int i) : real(r), imag(i) {}
    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Complex& obj);
};

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& out, const Complex& obj) {
    out << obj.real << " + " << obj.imag << "i";
    return out;
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"The `<<` and `>>` operators are overloaded as friend functions to facilitate formatted input and output for custom classes."

**When to use:** Use these operators to simplify object serialization and debugging.

---

## **3. What is the difference between member function and friend function in operator overloading?**
- **Member Function:** The left operand must be an instance of the class.
- **Friend Function:** Can have different types for both operands.

### **Example:**
```cpp
class Sample {
public:
    int value;
    Sample(int v) : value(v) {}
    Sample operator+(const Sample& obj) { return Sample(value + obj.value); } // Member function
    friend Sample operator-(const Sample& a, const Sample& b); // Friend function
};

Sample operator-(const Sample& a, const Sample& b) {
    return Sample(a.value - b.value);
}
```

### **Sample Answer:**
"Member functions allow the left operand to be the calling object, while friend functions provide more flexibility."

**When to use:** Use member functions when the left operand is an object of the class; use friend functions for symmetry in binary operations.

---

## **4. What are the best practices for operator overloading?**
- Use `const` for non-modifying operations.
- Overload `<<` and `>>` for user-defined types.
- Follow natural operator semantics (e.g., `+` should not subtract values).
- Prefer member functions where applicable.

### **Sample Answer:**
"Operator overloading should follow intuitive behavior, ensure efficiency, and use `const` where necessary."

**When to use:** Follow best practices to maintain readability and avoid unintended behavior.
