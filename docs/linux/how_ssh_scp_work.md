# What is SSH and SCP and How it Work and Where it Help

[SSH (Secure Shell)](https://www.openssh.com/) and **SCP (Secure Copy)** are **fundamental tools for secure communication and file management** across Linux, UNIX, and cloud environments.

* **SSH** establishes an encrypted channel that allows users to log into remote servers, execute commands, forward ports, and automate system administration safely and reliably.
* **SCP** builds on SSH to enable fast, secure, and authenticated file transfers between local and remote machines.

Together, they form the backbone of modern infrastructure management, empowering **developers, system administrators, DevOps engineers, and security professionals** to:

* Deploy applications seamlessly
* Transfer backups and sensitive data securely
* Troubleshoot and manage remote servers efficiently
* Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automation and scalability

:::tip Did You Know
* SSH can be used not just for remote login but also for **tunneling and port forwarding**, meaning you can securely connect to internal services behind firewalls.
* With the right configuration (using `~/.ssh/config`), you can set up **shortcuts and aliases** for frequently accessed servers, saving time and avoiding repetitive typing.
* While SCP is widely used, many modern setups prefer **rsync over SSH** for file transfers, since it supports incremental sync and better performance.

## Section 1: Why We Need SSH and SCP

In the early days of computing, administrators and developers had to be **physically present** at the machine to interact with it. As organizations grew and computer systems became distributed across offices, data centers, and later, the cloud, this approach became impractical.

###### Why secure remote access matters

**Remote access** was the solution. It allows a user to connect to a computer or server from anywhere in the world
 and:
* Manage systems without being physically present.
* Fix issues and deploy applications in real time.
* Access resources (databases, storage, or applications) that are hosted elsewhere.
* Support distributed teams working across different geographies.

Without remote access, every software update, server restart, or configuration change would require someone to **be on-site at the machine** a serious bottleneck in today’s fast-moving IT and cloud environments.

Before SSH, administrators used [Telnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet) and FTP, which transmitted everything including passwords in plain text. Any attacker on the same network could **sniff traffic and steal credentials**. Usernames, passwords, and even session data were exposed, making it easy for attackers to intercept and steal sensitive information.

This security gap created the need for a **safer alternative** and that’s where **SSH (Secure Shell)** came in. By adding **encryption, authentication, and integrity checks**, SSH made remote access secure, reliable, and scalabl


:::tip ssh  solve
SSH solved this by introducing **encryption, authentication, and integrity checks**, making it the de-facto standard for remote access.
:::

###### What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol that establishes a secure, encrypted session between a client and a server. 
It ensures that all communication—including commands, data, and authentication credentials is protected from eavesdropping, tampering, or impersonation.

SSH allows you to:
- Log into remote servers as if you were physically present.
- Execute administrative commands securely on remote machines.
- Forward or tunnel network traffic, providing secure access to internal services behind firewalls.
- Automate DevOps workflows using SSH keys, eliminating repetitive password entry in scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

:::caution just for information

*SSH was developed by ***Tatu Ylönen in 1995*** at the ***Helsinki University of Technology***, Finland, in response to growing security concerns over the use of Telnet and rlogin, which transmitted credentials in plain text.*

> **Today, it is the industry-standard protocol for secure remote administration across Linux, UNIX, and cloud environments.**
- More details: [RFC 4251 – The Secure Shell Protocol Architecture](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4251).

###### What is SCP?

**SCP (Secure Copy Protocol)** is a command-line tool for **secure file transfer** between local and remote systems. Unlike older protocols like FTP, SCP **does not require a separate daemon**—it leverages SSH for both authentication and encryption.

SCP is ideal for:

* Quick, one-off file or directory transfers.
* Uploading deployment packages to servers.
* Downloading logs, backups, or configuration files.

:::tip think to know
**History & Developer:** 
> *SCP was introduced alongside SSH in the mid-1990s and was also **developed by Tatu Ylönen**. It was designed as a secure alternative to the traditional `rcp` command.*

**Open Source:** 
> *SCP is part of the **OpenSSH project**, which is open source and distributed under a BSD-style license. This makes it freely available to view, modify, and distribute, contributing to its widespread adoption across Linux, UNIX, and cloud environments.*

**Pro Tip:** 
> *For larger directories or frequent syncing, `rsync -e ssh` is often preferred over SCP, as it supports incremental transfers, compression, and better performance.*

###### Real-World Use Cases

* **Developers:** 
> *Seamlessly **deploy code, configuration files, or updates** to remote servers without exposing passwords. SSH and SCP make it safe to work across development, staging, and production environments, ensuring your workflow remains secure and efficient.*

* **System Administrators:** 
> *Perform **emergency maintenance, patch updates, or configuration changes** on servers and cloud VMs from anywhere. Secure remote access reduces downtime and allows admins to troubleshoot issues quickly without physical presence.*

* **DevOps Engineers:** 
> *Efficiently **move build artifacts, logs, and deployment packages** across different stages of CI/CD pipelines. Using SSH and SCP ensures automation scripts can transfer files securely and reliably between servers or containers.*

* **Security Teams:** 
> *Here **Collect log, audit data, and sensitive information** from production systems without risking leaks. 
Encrypted transfers prevent interception, helping teams maintain compliance and safeguard critical infrastructure.*


## Section 2: SSH – Secure Remote Login

Before using SSH, **port 22 (the default SSH port)** must be open and accessible, because this is how clients communicate with the SSH server. Depending on your operating system, the installation and enabling process differs slightly.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```rust
# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openssh-client openssh-server
```

- **Enabling the Firewall**
```rust
sudo systemctl enable ssh
sudo systemctl start ssh
sudo systemctl status ssh
```

- RHEL/CentOS
```rust
sudo yum install openssh-clients openssh-server
```


</TabItem>
<TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">

```rust
# Enable Remote Login
sudo systemsetup -setremotelogin on
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
# Install OpenSSH Server
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0
```

- **Start & enable SSH service**

Start-Service sshd
Set-Service -Name sshd -StartupType 'Automatic'

- **Allow SSH through firewall**
```rust
New-NetFirewallRule `
  -Name "sshd" `
  -DisplayName "OpenSSH SSH Server" `
  -Enabled True `
  -Direction Inbound `
  -Protocol TCP `
  -LocalPort 22 `
  -Action Allow
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

###### Basic syntax


```rust
ssh <your-username>@<remote-host-ip>
```

**Steps to find the values:**

1. **Find your local username** (the account you use to log in to the remote machine):

```bash
whoami
```

2. **Find the remote host IP** (the machine you want to connect to):

```rust
ip addr show       # Linux
ifconfig           # Linux/macOS (older systems)
ipconfig           # Windows
```

3. **Combine them in the SSH command:**

```rust
ssh aitr@192.168.0.106
```

> 💡 For more details on finding your machine IP, see: [Know Your Machine IP](https://www.compilersutra.com/docs/linux/know_machine_ip/)


###### Troubleshooting

* **Connection refused** → Ensure `sshd` is running: `systemctl status ssh`.
* **Permission denied (publickey)** → Check SSH keys or use `ssh-copy-id`.
* **Host unreachable** → Verify firewall rules and network routes.

## Section 3: Pro SSH Usage

By default, SSH uses **port 22**, but some servers may run SSH on a different port for security reasons. You can connect using the `-p` option:

```rust
ssh -p 2222 user@remote_host
```

* Replace `2222` with the server’s SSH port.
* Replace `user` with your remote username and `remote_host` with the server’s IP or hostname.


###### 2. Running a Remote Command

SSH allows you to **execute a command on a remote machine** without logging in interactively:

```rust
ssh user@remote_host "df -h /"
```

* This example shows disk usage of the root directory (`/`).
* Any command enclosed in quotes will run on the remote server and return the output locally.


###### 3. Automating Logins with SSH Keys

SSH keys allow **password-less authentication**, improving security and enabling automation in scripts and CI/CD pipelines.

**Step 1: Generate a key pair**

```rust
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

* `-t ed25519` specifies the modern, secure key type.
* `-C` adds a comment (usually your email) for identification.
* Follow prompts to save the key (`~/.ssh/id_ed25519` by default).

**Step 2: Copy the public key to the remote server**

```rust
ssh-copy-id user@remote_host
```

* This installs your public key in the remote server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
* After this, you can log in without entering a password:

```rust
ssh user@remote_host
```

> **Pro Tip:** Protect your private key with a passphrase and use `ssh-agent` to cache it for convenience.
