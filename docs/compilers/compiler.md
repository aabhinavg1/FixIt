# üîç Know Your Compilers

Welcome to the **Compiler Documentation**! Explore each stage and component of the compiler, from front-end parsing to architecture-specific optimizations for GPU, CPU, and more.

## Contents

- **[Introduction to Compilers](intro.md)**  
  Get a broad understanding of compilers, their purpose, and various types in the programming world.

- **[Know Your Compilers](Know_Your_Compilers.md)**  
  Dive deeper into the details of different compilers and understand their unique features.

## Sections

- **[Flags](flag/index.md)**: Explore the various compiler flags and their effects on code optimization, debugging, and performance tuning.
- **[Front End](front_end/index.md)**: Learn about the front-end process of a compiler, including lexical analysis, syntax parsing, and AST generation.
- **[Back End](back_end/index.md)**: Understand the back-end workings, from intermediate representation (IR) to code generation and optimization.
- **[GPU](GPU/index.md)**: Dive into GPU-specific compiler technologies, with a focus on parallelism and memory optimization.
- **[CPU](CPU/index.md)**: Explore CPU-focused optimizations and architectures, covering instruction sets and performance tuning.
- **[Other Architectures](other_arch/index.md)**: Learn about compilers for additional architectures, including embedded systems, FPGAs, and custom hardware.
