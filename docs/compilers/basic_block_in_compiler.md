In ***compiler design***, ***basic blocks*** are like the sentences of a program’s story  `short, continuous sequences of instructions` with no ***interruptions***x.

If you want to understand optimizations, performance, or correctness in any C++ compiler toolchain (LLVM/Clang or GCC), you need to be comfortable with:

- What a basic block is – a straight-line piece of code with one entry and one exit.
- Why it exists – making it easier for compilers to analyze and optimize.
- How to detect and count them – the starting point of control flow analysis.

:::tip Remember it as
Just as sentences structure a story, basic blocks structure programs.

✨“The ***compiler reads programs*** *the way we read stories*  ***one sentence (basic block) at a time*** .”

## What is a Basic Block?

A **basic block** is a maximal straight-line sequence of instructions that has:

1. **One entry point** – control always begins at the first instruction of the block.
2. **One exit point** – control leaves only at the last instruction.
3. **No internal jumps** – there are no branches into or out of the middle of the block.

:::caution In simpler terms:
 once execution enters a basic block, every instruction inside it will run in order, until the block finishes.

<TabItem value="Snippet to understand basic block" label="basic cpp code to understand basic block" default>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int x = 5;
    if (x > 0) {
        cout << "Positive" << endl;
    }
    cout << "Done" << endl;
    return 0;
}

  }}
/>
<details>
<summary><strong> Digram Explanation </strong></summary>

This diagram shows:
- `Block 1` initializes x and checks the condition.
- If the condition is `true` → `go` to `Block 2` (print "Positive"), then flow continues to `Block 3`.
- If the condition is `false` → `jump` directly to `Block 3`.

`Block 3` is the final block that always `executes before exit`.
</details>
1. **Block 1 (Entry + Condition)**

   * `int x = 5;`
   * `if (x > 0)` → This introduces a possible branch.
   * Control can either go to **Block 2** (if true) or **Block 3** (if false).

2. **Block 2 (True branch)**

   * `cout << "Positive" << endl;`
   * Control flows to **Block 3**.

3. **Block 3 (Join + Exit)**

   * `cout << "Done" << endl;`
   * `return 0;`



:::important Why These Are Basic Blocks

* In **Block 1**, you must execute `x = 5;` and then check the condition before deciding where to go. You cannot jump into the middle.
* **Block 2** is straight-line (only one statement, then fall through).
* **Block 3** is also straight-line and ends the program.

:::tip In the code
the program’s control flow graph (CFG) has **3 nodes (basic blocks)** connected by edges based on the branch.

### Why Basic Blocks Matter

So far, we have understood **what a basic block is**:

In simple terms, a **basic block is a straight-line sequence of instructions with no branches**. 

 > *Once execution enters a basic block, it will execute all instructions in order until the end.*


Whenever a **branch or jump** occurs, the instructions following the branch start a **new basic block**. 
> *This division of code into blocks allows the compiler to* **reason about control flow in a structured way**.
<details>
<summary><strong>1. **Foundation for Optimizations**</strong></summary>
   * Many optimizations, such as **constant folding**, **dead code elimination (DCE)**, and              
                   **common subexpression elimination**, rely on the linearity of basic blocks.

   * Within a block, the order of execution is guaranteed, making it simpler for the compiler to detect and apply safe transformations.

  
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 2. **Core of the Control-Flow Graph (CFG)**</strong></summary>

   * Basic blocks form the **nodes** of a CFG, while edges represent possible 
   **control transfers**: 
   branches, jumps, and fallthroughs.
   * This representation is essential for analyses like **loop detection**, 
               **branch prediction**, and **interprocedural optimization**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 3. **Basis for Advanced Analyses**</strong></summary>

   * Techniques like **dominators**, **liveness analysis**, **dataflow analysis**, 
   **SSA form**,and **instruction scheduling** operate at the block level.
   * Without basic blocks, these analyses would be much more complex or inefficient.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 4. **Performance and Code Layout Implications** </strong></summary>

   * The **number, size, and structure** of blocks affect **branch prediction, instruction cache behavior, and pipeline efficiency**.
   * Compilers often reorder, split, or merge blocks to improve execution speed and optimize memory usage.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 5. **Simplifies Reasoning About Code**</strong></summary>

*By grouping sequential instructions into blocks*, the compiler can focus 
on **meaningful sequences of instructions**, making optimizations safer and 
analysis more precise.

</details>

## How Compilers Build CFGs

Before jumping in to *how compilers build CFGs* ***let's understand first what cfg is***
:::tip Defination
:::
> A **Control Flow Graph (CFG)** is a **graphical representation of all paths that might be traversed through a program during its execution**.
> -  **Nodes** in a CFG represent **basic blocks** which is a  ***straight-line sequences*** of
instructions with no branches except at the end.
> -  **Edges** represent **possible transfers of control** from one block to another.

:::important In simple words:
> A CFG shows ***how the program can*** `flow` from ***one block of code to another*** depending on conditions, loops, and jumps.
:::

<details>
 <summary> **Why CFG is Useful** </summary>

:::tip **Why CFG is Useful** 

1. **Understanding Program Flow:** 
          - Helps visualize how a ***program executes***, ***including loops***, ***branches***, and ***conditional statements***.
2. **Compiler Optimizations:** 
          - Enables transformations like ***dead code elimination***, ***loop optimization***, and ***constant propagation***.
3. **Error Detection & Analysis:** 
          - Identifies unreachable ***code***, ***infinite loops***, and ***potential logical errors***.

> ***Let's understand it with the example what cfg is*** :-
>> - To make the concept of a ***Control Flow Graph (CFG)*** concrete, ***let’s walk through a simple*** example `with snippet`.


---

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Snippet to understand the cpp" label="Code Snippet" default>

```cpp
if (x > 0)
    y = 1;
else
    y = 2;
z = y + 3;
```
This code has a simple **conditional statement** and a continuation after the branch.

 **Step 1: Identify Basic Blocks**

A **basic block** is a sequence of statements that **execute sequentially**, with **no jumps or branches except at the end**.

For this example, we can divide the code into **four basic blocks**:
<details>
<summary><strong>1. **Block 1 – Condition Check**</strong></summary>

```c
if (x > 0)
```

> ***This block decides which path the program will follow.***
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 2. **Block 2 – True Branch**</strong></summary>

```c
y = 1;
```

- ***Executed only if the condition in Block 1 is true***.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. **Block 3 – False Branch**</strong></summary>

```c
y = 2;
```

* Executed only if the condition in Block 1 is **false**.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. **Block 4 – Merge / Continuation**</strong></summary>

```c
z = y + 3;
```

- ***Executed after either Block 2 or Block 3, where both paths converge.***
</details>

* **Basic Blocks:**

  1. Condition check: `if (x > 0)`
  2. True branch: `y = 1`
  3. False branch: `y = 2`
  4. Merge/continuation: `z = y + 3`

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="CFG of the code to understand" label="CFG to understand" default>

## LLVM/Clang: Inspect, Visualize, and Count Basic Blocks


Understanding basic blocks in **LLVM/Clang** is crucial for anyone working on compiler optimizations, code analysis, or performance tuning. Once we know what a basic block is and why it matters, the next step is to **inspect, visualize, and count them** in real programs.

### Programmatic Method (C++ tool using LLVM APIs)

Here's how to create a ***C++ tool*** using ***LLVM APIs*** to programmatically count basic blocks:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Understand how LLVM work " label="llvm understanding" default>
LLVM represents code using a **well-defined hierarchical structure** that allows sophisticated analysis, transformation, and optimization. When you compile C++ code, LLVM first translates it into an **Intermediate Representation (IR)**, which preserves the operations and control flow in a structured format.

*The hierarchy works like this:*
<img
  src="/img/llvm_infra.svg"
  alt="WHat is llvm how to write llvm pass"
  style={{
    width: '100%',
    maxWidth: '400px',
    height: 'auto',
    display: 'block',
    margin: '0 auto'
  }}
/>
<details>
<summary><strong> LLVM INFRA </strong></summary>

Let's get an ***abstract level idea** of the components in an LLVM program:

- A Module in LLVM corresponds, approximately, to a single source file or more precisely, to a translation unit. 
> ***All other constructs live inside a Module.***

- Within a Module, the most important entities are Functions. These represent callable pieces of code, and in C++ both free functions and class methods map to LLVM Functions.

- A Function primarily consists of BasicBlocks. A basic block, well-known in compiler design, is simply a linear sequence of instructions with no internal branches control only enters at the beginning and exits at the end.

- Each Instruction represents a single low-level operation. The granularity is similar to machine instructions in a RISC architecture, such as integer addition, floating-point division, or writing a value to memory.

- In LLVM’s hierarchy, almost everything including Functions, BasicBlocks, and Instructions is derived from a common superclass named Value. 

- A Value denotes any computable entity: a literal constant (like 5), a global variable, or even the address of a piece of code.


<details>
<summary><strong> 1. **Module** – The top-level container for an entire translation unit (typically a C++ file).</strong> </summary>

   * Contains all **Functions**, global variables, and type definitions.
   * Think of it as a “project folder” containing everything needed for compilation.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 2. **Function** – Represents a callable routine, like `main()` or helper functions. </strong></summary>

   * Each function is independent and has its own **control flow**.
   * Functions are made up of one or more **Basic Blocks**.
</details>
<details>
<summary><strong> 3. **Basic Block** – A straight-line sequence of instructions that **executes sequentially without branching** (except at the end).</strong></summary>

   * Ends with a **terminator instruction**, such as `ret` (return), `br` (branch), or `switch`.
   * Think of it as a single “paragraph” of instructions where control flows linearly.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong> 4. **Instruction** – The smallest unit in LLVM IR.</strong></summary>

   * Performs specific operations such as arithmetic, memory access, or control flow changes.
   * Consists of:

     * **Opcode** – The operation being performed (e.g., `add`, `sub`, `load`, `store`, `br`, `ret`).
     * **Operands** – The inputs or data the instruction acts on (variables, constants, or results from other instructions).
   * Instructions are the building blocks that actually do the computation.
</details>
</details>

:::tip What We are Trying to Achieve

> :::caution **Q:**  
> We want to **analyze the control-flow structure** of a C++ program by counting how many **Basic Blocks** exist inside each **Function**.

:::important note
Since LLVM works on **LLVM IR**, not directly on C++, we first compile the C++ code into LLVM IR. Then, using the LLVM API, we load that IR and inspect its structure.
:::

:::note So the overall goal is:
* Take a C++ program
* Convert it into LLVM IR (because that’s the representation LLVM understands)
* Traverse the IR hierarchy:
  **Module → Function → Basic Block → Instruction**
* Count the **Basic Blocks** per Function and report them
:::

Here is the complete implementation of the LLVM Function

```cpp
#include "llvm/IR/LLVMContext.h"      // Core LLVM context for IR objects
#include "llvm/IR/Module.h"           // Represents the whole IR module (translation unit)
#include "llvm/IRReader/IRReader.h"   // For reading LLVM IR from a file
#include "llvm/Support/SourceMgr.h"   // Error handling while parsing IR
#include "llvm/Support/raw_ostream.h" // LLVM's own output stream (like std::cout)

using namespace llvm;

int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    // Check if an input IR file is provided
    if (argc < 2) {
        errs() << "Usage: " << argv[0] << " <IR file>\n";
        return 1;
    }

    LLVMContext Context;   // Stores LLVM's global data (types, constants, etc.)
    SMDiagnostic Err;      // For capturing parsing errors

    // Parse the given IR file into a Module
    std::unique_ptr<Module> Mod = parseIRFile(argv[1], Err, Context);
    if (!Mod) {
        // Print error if parsing fails

<TabItem value="How To run " label="how to Build and Run" default>
To build and run the `bb_counter` tool:

1. **Compile the code with LLVM libraries**

   * You must tell the compiler where to find LLVM headers and which LLVM libraries to link against.
   * The `llvm-config` utility makes this easier by providing the correct include paths, linker flags, and libraries.

   Generic form:

   ```rust
   clang++ -I `llvm-config --includedir` bb_counter.cpp -o bb_counter \
       `llvm-config --ldflags --libs core irreader support`
   ```
<details>
<summary>clang++</summary>

`clang++` is the LLVM-based C++ compiler.  
We use it instead of `g++` here since it aligns naturally with LLVM libraries.
</details>
 <details>
<summary> -I `llvm-config --includedir`</summary>

- `-I` adds an **include directory** to the compiler search path.  
- `` `llvm-config --includedir` `` executes `llvm-config`, which prints the path to LLVM's **header files** (like `llvm/IR/...`).  
👉 This ensures the compiler finds LLVM’s header files during compilation.
</details>

<details>
<summary> bb_counter.cpp</summary>

This is the **source file** you are compiling.  
It contains your code (e.g., LLVM pass or IR analysis tool).
</details>

<details>
<summary> -o bb_counter</summary>

Specifies the **output binary name**.  
The compiled program will be created as `bb_counter`.
</details>

<details>
<summary> `llvm-config --ldflags`</summary>

Provides the **linker flags** needed for LLVM.  
For example: rpath settings, `-L` paths where LLVM libraries are installed.  
👉 Ensures the linker can find LLVM libraries at link time.
</details>

<details>
<summary> `llvm-config --libs core irreader support`</summary>

- Tells the linker **which LLVM libraries to link against**.  
- `core` → Core LLVM IR classes & utilities.  
- `irreader` → Support for parsing `.ll` or `.bc` files into LLVM IR.  
- `support` → Common utility functions (command-line handling, error mgmt, etc.).  
👉 Without these, the compiler would complain about undefined references.
</details>

2. **Run the tool**

   * The tool expects an LLVM IR file (`.ll` or `.bc`) as input.
   * If you run it without arguments, it shows usage instructions.

   Example:

   ```rust
   ./bb_counter test.ll
   ```

3. **Alternative: Build with CMake**

   * Instead of a raw compile command, you can integrate with CMake using `find_package(LLVM)`.
   * This makes your project portable across systems.

## What Next
In this article, we understood what basic blocks are, why they matter, and how to inspect and visualize them using LLVM/Clang.

👉 In the next article, we’ll take this one step further   you’ll learn how to add your own Basic Block analysis as an LLVM plugin.
We’ll cover:
- How LLVM’s pass/plugin system works
- Writing a simple analysis pass for counting basic blocks
- Registering it as a plugin
Running it with opt

So stay tuned   this is where theory meets practice!

## FAQ
<ComicQA
  question="1) What is a Basic Block in LLVM?"
  answer="A Basic Block is a straight-line sequence of instructions with no branches in except to the entry and no branches out except at the exit."
  code={`; Example LLVM IR
entry:
  %a = add i32 %x, %y
  br label %next`}
  example="// Think of it as one uninterrupted path of code."
  whenToUse="When analyzing control flow or optimization passes."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="2) Why are Basic Blocks important?"
  answer="They are the fundamental units of control flow in a program and form the nodes of a Control Flow Graph (CFG)."
  code={`// C++ if-statement splits into 3 blocks
if (x > 0) { ... } else { ... }`}
  example="// Each branch creates a new basic block."
  whenToUse="When you want to understand branching and program flow."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="3) How does LLVM represent Basic Blocks?"
  answer="LLVM IR represents Basic Blocks with labels followed by instructions, ending with a terminator (like br or ret)."
  code={`bb1:
  %1 = add i32 %a, %b
  br label %bb2`}
  example="// Labels mark block boundaries."
  whenToUse="When traversing LLVM IR programmatically."
/>


<ComicQA
  question="4) What’s the difference between a Basic Block and a Function?"
  answer="A Function contains multiple Basic Blocks, but a Basic Block cannot contain another Function."
  code={`define i32 @foo(i32 %x) {
entry: 
  %y = add i32 %x, 1
  ret i32 %y
}`}
  example="// Function is the container, blocks are the building units."
  whenToUse="When explaining program structure hierarchy."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="5) Can one instruction belong to two Basic Blocks?"
  answer="No. An instruction belongs to exactly one Basic Block."
  code={`// Each block owns its instructions
bb1: %1 = add i32 %a, %b`}
  example="// Ownership is strict."
  whenToUse="When iterating over instructions in LLVM APIs."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="6) How do branches affect Basic Blocks?"
  answer="Conditional and unconditional branches terminate a block and create successors."
  code={`br i1 %cond, label %iftrue, label %iffalse`}
  example="// Each branch target becomes a new block."
  whenToUse="When constructing or analyzing CFGs."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="7) Can a Basic Block exist without a terminator?"
  answer="No. Every Basic Block must end with a terminator instruction (ret, br, switch)."
  code={`ret i32 0`}
  example="// Terminator defines exit of the block."
  whenToUse="When validating correctness of LLVM IR."
/>

<ComicQA
  question="8) How can I programmatically count Basic Blocks in LLVM C++ API?"
  answer="By iterating over each Function and then over each BasicBlock inside it."
  code={`for (auto &F : M)
  for (auto &BB : F)
    count++;`}
  example="// Double loop: Functions → Blocks."
  whenToUse="When building analysis tools or research projects."
/>
