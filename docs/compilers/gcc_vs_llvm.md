# LLVM vs GCC: Performance, Architecture, and Benchmarks Compared

When it comes to compiler technology, LLVM and GCC are two of the most prominent choices. Both serve as essential tools for developers, but they have distinct architectures, features, and use cases. This article provides an in-depth comparison of LLVM and GCC.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature                              | LLVM                                                                                      | GCC                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**                       | A modular, reusable compiler framework with an intermediate representation (LLVM IR).     | A traditional, monolithic compiler suite with front-end, optimization, and back-end components. |
| **Architecture**                     | Modular and reusable; separate front-end, optimizer, and back-end.                        | Monolithic; tightly integrated compiler passes.                                                 |
| **Intermediate Representation (IR)** | Uses LLVM IR, which is SSA (Static Single Assignment) based and platform-independent.     | Uses GIMPLE and RTL as IRs, which are more tied to GCC's optimization and back-end structure.   |
| **Language Support**                 | Supports C, C++, Rust, Swift, Julia, and more.                                            | Primarily supports C, C++, Fortran, Ada, Go, and Objective-C.                                   |
| **Compilation Speed**                | Faster due to its modular approach and just-in-time (JIT) compilation capabilities.       | Slower in comparison, as it compiles and optimizes code in a single pipeline.                   |
| **Optimization**                     | Provides advanced optimizations and link-time optimizations (LTO).                        | Strong optimizations but lacks some modern modularity of LLVM.                                  |
| **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**   | Supports JIT compilation, useful for runtime optimizations and interpreters.              | No built-in JIT support.                                                                        |
| **Target Architecture**              | Easier to add support for new architectures due to its modularity.                        | Supports multiple architectures but is harder to extend.                                        |
| **Error Reporting**                  | Provides more detailed and user-friendly error messages.                                  | Error messages can be cryptic and harder to understand.                                         |
| **Debugging & Tooling**              | Has powerful debugging tools (like LLDB) and static analysis tools.                       | Relies on external tools like GDB for debugging.                                                |
| **Licensing**                        | Uses a permissive Apache 2.0-style license, allowing proprietary use.                     | Uses the GNU General Public License (GPL), which enforces open-source distribution.             |
| **Industry Usage**                   | Used in Appleâ€™s Clang, Android NDK, Rust compiler, Swift, and GPU computing (CUDA, ROCm). | Used in Linux kernel development, embedded systems, and traditional Unix-like environments.     |
| **Ease of Development**              | Easier to develop and extend due to its modular structure.                                | More complex and harder to modify due to its monolithic design.                                 |

## LLVM IR vs GCC IR: Differences, Performance & Optimization

GCC uses a two-phase intermediate representation system:
1. **GIMPLE**: A high-level, structured, SSA-based representation used for early optimizations.
2. **RTL (Register Transfer Language)**: A low-level, target-dependent representation used in the backend for code generation and machine-specific optimizations.

### Why LLVM IR is Superior to GCC IR

| Feature             | LLVM IR                                      | GCC IR (GIMPLE & RTL)                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **SSA-Based Design** | Fully SSA-based, facilitating advanced optimizations. | GIMPLE is SSA-based, but RTL is not fully SSA. |
| **Platform Independence** | Designed to be portable across multiple architectures. | RTL is highly tied to specific architectures. |
| **Optimization Capabilities** | Supports aggressive optimizations, inlining, vectorization, and loop unrolling. | GIMPLE optimizations are strong, but RTL-based optimizations are more constrained. |
| **Metadata Support** | Rich metadata for debugging, profiling, and static analysis. | Limited debugging metadata compared to LLVM. |
| **Code Reusability** | Used across compilers, JITs, and research projects beyond just Clang. | Mostly tied to GCC's internal workflow. |

## Why is the Industry Shifting Toward LLVM?

1. **Modularity** - LLVMâ€™s modular structure allows developers to integrate custom front-ends, optimizers, and back-ends seamlessly.
2. **Better Tooling** - LLVM provides LLDB for debugging and Clang-based static analysis, which are superior to GCCâ€™s tooling.
3. **Licensing** - LLVMâ€™s permissive license makes it more attractive for commercial and proprietary compiler development.
4. **JIT Support** - LLVMâ€™s Just-In-Time compilation capability makes it the preferred choice for runtime optimization and dynamic languages.
5. **Easier Extensibility** - LLVM's well-structured APIs enable adding support for new languages and architectures with less effort.

## Viewing Compilation Passes with GCC and LLVM

This section explains how to see each compilation pass on a sample testcase using GCC and LLVM. It also mentions that LLVM relies on the Clang front end.

## Viewing Passes with GCC

GCC provides the `-fdump-tree-all` and `-fdump-ipa-all` options to inspect different compilation passes.

### Example:
```rust
gcc -O2 -fdump-tree-all -fdump-ipa-all sample.c -o sample.out
```

This generates various `.dump` files showing different optimization and transformation stages.

For a more specific view, you can use:
```rust
gcc -O2 -fdump-tree-original -fdump-tree-optimized sample.c -o sample.out
```

### Middle-End and Backend in GCC and LLVM

GCC does not have a clearly separated middle-end and backend pass like LLVM. However, its optimization and transformation passes are part of the internal tree and RTL representations.

LLVM has a separate tool known as `opt` for the middle-end and `llc` for the backend, which makes it more modular and flexible for updates.

- **Middle-End Pass:** `opt` is used for applying various optimizations at the LLVM IR level.
   ```rust
      opt --print-passes  #to see all passes you have 
   ```
- **Backend Pass:** `llc` is used for converting LLVM IR to target-specific assembly.

## Viewing Passes with LLVM (Clang)

LLVM relies on the Clang front end. You can use `opt` and `clang` to inspect different passes.

### Example:
```rust
clang -S -emit-llvm sample.c -o sample.ll
opt -O2 -debug-pass=Structure sample.ll -o optimized.bc
```

### Middle-End and Backend in LLVM

- **Middle-End Pass:** `opt` is used for applying various optimizations at the LLVM IR level.
- **Backend Pass:** `llc` is used for converting LLVM IR to target-specific assembly.

:::tip
## Insight

- GCC uses `-fdump-tree-all` to show internal transformation passes.
- LLVM relies on Clang and `opt` for pass inspection.
- LLVM IR (`.ll` files) helps in understanding the transformation pipeline.
- LLVM has a clear middle-end (`opt`) and backend (`llc`), whereas GCC does not have a strict separation.

## Key Takeaways

- **LLVM** is more modern, modular, and flexible, making it ideal for new compiler development and research.
- **GCC** is mature and battle-tested, widely used in embedded systems and operating system development.
- **JIT Compilation** is a unique advantage of LLVM, making it preferable for dynamic languages and runtime optimizations.
- **LLVM IR** is more efficient, flexible, and portable compared to GCCâ€™s IR.
- **Licensing** differences impact commercial and open-source adoption, with LLVM being more permissive.

:::note
Both LLVM and GCC are powerful in their own right. The choice depends on specific use cases, project requirements, and licensing preferences. If you are building a new compiler or need JIT support, LLVM might be the better choice. If you need a stable, well-established compiler for system programming, GCC remains a strong contender.
