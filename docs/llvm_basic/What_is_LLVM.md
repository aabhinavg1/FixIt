## What is LLVM?

LLVM (Low-Level Virtual Machine) is a robust compiler infrastructure which is designed to support life long program analysis and transformation for any program by providing high-level information to compiler during runtime, link-time, and in idle time between the runs optimizing programs during compilation. Initially developed as a research project, LLVM has grown into a vast ecosystem that supports various stages of compiling source code into machine code. 

The LLVM project includes:
- **LLVM Core**: The compiler's core infrastructure for code generation and optimization.
- **Clang**: A front-end for C, C++, and Objective-C.
- **LLD**: The LLVM linker.
- **LLDB**: A powerful debugger built using the LLVM infrastructure.

## Where is LLVM Used?

LLVM is widely used across different platforms and industries, such as:
- **Compilers**: LLVM is the backbone of many modern compilers like Clang.
- **Operating Systems**: It helps in building OS components efficiently, like in Apple's macOS and iOS.
- **Graphics and Game Development**: Graphics APIs like Vulkan use LLVM-based shaders.
- **Research**: Used as a base for compiler research and advanced programming language implementations.

## Why Learn LLVM?

Understanding LLVM opens the door to a wide range of possibilities in compiler development, program analysis, and performance optimization. Its modular architecture allows you to create custom compiler passes and manipulate intermediate representations (IR), giving you control over the compilation process.
